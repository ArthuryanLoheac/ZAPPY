## ‚ú® Special Commands

### üëã WELCOME command

The welcome command is sent by the server to the client when it connects.
The AI must reply with the team name to authenticate itself.

After the team name is sent, the server will send the map size and the number of slots available for the team.

It should look like this, where `->` is the server and `<-` is the client:

```
-> WELCOME
<- {team_name}
-> {map_x} {map_y}
-> {slots_available}
```

### ‚ò†Ô∏è DEAD command

The dead command is sent by the server to the client when the AI dies.
The AI does not need to send any command to get this information, and it also does not need to reply to it.

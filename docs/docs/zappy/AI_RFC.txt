                            Zappy AI Protocol

Abstract

   This document defines the communication protocol between the Zappy
   server and its AI client. It describes the format, structure, and
   semantics of messages exchanged over the network. The protocol is
   designed to support real-time decision-making and actions by AI
   players.

1. Introduction

   The Zappy AI protocol enables AI clients to interact with the game
   server. It provides a set of ASCII-based textual commands for player
   actions, resource management, and team coordination. All messages are
   line-based and terminated by a newline character ('\n').

                                                               [Page 2]

3. Server to Client Messages

   The following commands are sent by the server to the AI client:

   WELCOME <CRLF> ->
      Initial connection message

   DEAD <CRLF> ->
      Player death notification

   {map_x} <SP> {map_y} <CRLF> ->
      Map dimensions

   {slots_available} <CRLF> ->
      Number of available slots for the team

                                                               [Page 3]

4. Client to Server Messages

   The AI client may send the following commands to the server:

   Forward <CRLF> ->
      Move up one tile

   Right <CRLF> ->
      Turn 90° right

   Left <CRLF> ->
      Turn 90° left

   Look <CRLF> ->
      Look around

   Inventory <CRLF> ->
      Request player inventory

   Broadcast <SP> {Message} <CRLF> ->
      Broadcast a message

   Connect_nbr <CRLF> ->
      Request number of unused team slots

   Fork <CRLF> ->
      Fork a new player

   Eject <CRLF> ->
      Eject players from the current tile

   Take <SP> object <CRLF> ->
      Take an object from the current tile

   Set <SP> object <CRLF> ->
      Set an object down on the current tile

   Incantation <CRLF> ->
      Start an incantation

                                                               [Page 4]

5. Message Format and Semantics

   - All messages are encoded in UTF-8 and terminated by a newline
      character ('\n').
   - All messages are case insensitive.
   - Commands must follow exact spelling and spacing. Any deviation may
      result in:
      - 'ko' (bad or unknown command)


6. Versioning

   Protocol Version: 1.0
   Future protocol changes must increment the version number.
   Compatibility is not guaranteed between major versions.

7. Security Considerations

   This protocol assumes a trusted local network environment. No
   authentication, encryption, or integrity checks are built-in.
   It's strongly advised not to expose the protocol interface to public
   networks without an external secure layer (e.g., SSH tunnel, VPN).

                                                               [Page 5]
